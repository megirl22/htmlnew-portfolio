<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> I am an Web Developer and AI Engineer. I come from the tiny state of Maryland and about less than 30 mins from DC.
I’m the oldest of five kids and have a proud Nigerian heritage. Among my achievements, one of them was graduating from the University of Maryland Baltimore County with a degree in Communications. I’ve always had a passion for technology. So in 2023, I changed careers path from social media marketing and decided to pursue in software engineering and AI. I’ve studied Python, HTML, Linux, CSS, Java, and many more. And everyday I make it my mission to learn more about AI and build the future applications that will impact society. </p>
